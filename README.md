## 時間序列分析(課堂專題)
### Data (attached file data.csv) comes from time series data of a stock price or index. 
### Use the first 990 time series for estimation and the last 10 time series for prediction.

#### 分析流程 :

(a) Draw the graph of the original data, the simple return graph and the log return

(b) Check whether the original data, simple return data, and log return data are
stationary.

(c) Draw the plots of the ACFs and the PACFs of the log return data. 

(d) Suppose the log return data comes from the ARMA(p, q) model with Gaussian
white noise. Use the EACF, AIC, and BIC to decide p and q.

(e) Use the built-in functions to find maximum likelihood estimates of
parameters.

(f) Use the exact maximum likelihood estimates of parameters to find the
estimates of error.

(g) Test whether these estimates of error are uncorrelated and come from
Gaussian distribution

(h) Draw the last 10 log return data including 10 predicted values and 95%
confidence interval.

(i) Final conclusion.
